# Fruits Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) image classification model training to classify different fruit types. The AI model used for the classification task is RexNet ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/clovaai/rexnet)) and the dataset for training is [Fruits 100 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/fruits-100/data). The project in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/killa92/sports-classification-pytorch-98-accuracy). The models can be trained using two different frameworks ([PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/)).
